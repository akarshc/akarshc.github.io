    <h1>Akarsh Cholapurth</h1>
    <img src="./assets/images/akarsh-pic.jpeg" style="width: 200px;" />
    <p>I'm a maker with experience in web development since 2010, along with UI/UX design, research, full-stack development, and DevOps. I'm currently building <a href="https://modelriver.com" target="_blank">ModelRiver</a>, a developer platform focused on making production-grade AI workflows reliable, observable, and easy to reason about. Also I built <a href="https://hyperzoned.com" target="_blank">Hyperzoned</a>, an AI-powered, minimal project management app based on the "3 tasks a day" method.</p>
    
    <h2>What is ModelRiver?</h2>
    <p>
      After working with multiple AI models in production, one pattern kept repeating. Integrations became fragile as soon as workflows went async. Each provider came with its own SDKs, auth mechanisms, response formats, and failure modes. Handling retries, observability, testing, and real-time updates quickly turned into custom glue code scattered across the codebase.
    </p>

    <p>
      ModelRiver is an attempt to bring order to that chaos. It provides a single, consistent layer for running AI workflows with proper async execution, retries, observability, and local-first development, so developers can experiment safely and ship production-grade AI systems with confidence.
    </p>


    <h2>What is Hyperzoned?</h2>
    <p>When I want to start a task, should I really have to open a kanban board, check what's pending, break it into atomic subtasks, and then begin? That feels like too many steps.<br><br>
    In Hyperzoned, you can <strong>create a project</strong>, then define goals (weekly or monthly) and add milestones within those goals. That's it. It's a one-time setup, similar to creating a new task in a kanban board (but much less often).<br><br>
    Each morning, you can click <strong>"New Task"</strong>, select the goal and milestone you want to work on (your previous one is auto-selected if you're continuing), and Hyperzoned's AI will generate a focused task by breaking it into small, actionable steps. you can create up to three meaningful tasks per day across different projects, goals, or milestones, helping you stay focused without overwhelm.</p>
    
    <h2>Previous projects</h2>
    <p>I have worked on several projects before Hyperzoned. Notable ones are:<br><br>
    <strong>Vieww.me</strong> — a web app that helps users create a single-page web portfolio with minimal information in under 3 minutes. The app was featured on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/vieww">Product Hunt</a> and gained good traction in the market but was eventually shut down due to the lack of a sustainable business model.</p>
    <p><strong>StickWithSEO.com</strong> — a website that analyzed any webpage's SEO performance using a custom-defined search engine algorithm back in 2016–17. Prior to that, I created several blogs, WordPress plugins, and themes.</p>
    
    <h3>How did I end up in development?</h3>
    <p>My passion for creating things online started early. Back in the 2010s, I loved experimenting with free website builders like Blogspot, WordPress, and Google Sites, even using free <strong>.tk</strong> domains to publish small projects. To make my Blogspot themes look more unique and professional, I began learning <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. What started as simple theme tweaks soon turned into a genuine interest in web design and development.</p>
    <p>Eventually, I registered my first domain and hosted a WordPress site on HostGator using FTP and FileZilla. Working with WordPress introduced me to <strong>PHP</strong>, which felt confusing at first without any prior programming experience. Still, I managed to make small edits and customizations, and even designed graphics and logos for my websites.</p>
    <p>Around the same time, I was pursuing my higher studies and had just a basic understanding of <strong>C++</strong> from school. I monetized my blog through <strong>Google AdSense</strong> and still remember receiving my <a href="./assets/images/first-cheque.jpg" target="_blank">first revenue cheque from Google</a>. Back then, I posted tech blogs daily, optimizing them with SEO and keyword strategies and surprisingly, it worked quite well!</p>
    <p>During my second year of college, things slowed down, and I had to pause blogging for a while. A year later, I discovered something fascinating: people were building incredible web applications known as <strong>Single Page Applications (SPAs)</strong>. Curious, I took my first <strong>React course</strong> by <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/" target="_blank">Andrei Neagoie's Zero to mastery</a>. I didn't code along at first, just watched. But for my final year project, I built <strong>StickWithSEO.com</strong> — a PHP-based web app that analyzed website SEO using basic scraping and algorithms. That was my first full programming project, and it made me realize how much I truly loved building software.</p>
    <p>After that, I revisited the React course, this time coding alongside it. I quickly picked up <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js (Express.js)</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>, and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. Soon after, a friend and I started building a new web app — <strong>Vieww.me</strong>. That project taught me more than any course could: from frontend optimization to server deployment.</p>
    <p class="italic">"I started coding to solve my own problems, and I never stopped learning."</p>

    <h2>A bit about me</h2>
    <p>I would describe myself as a true "Jack of all trades, master of none", and I think that's perfectly fine. Over time, I've learned to embrace this as a strength because it allows me to explore and do many things instead of just one. I've realized that with enough effort and focus, I can create meaningful and impactful work, and that's exactly what I'm doing now.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy watching movies, photography (<a href="./assets/images/old-photograph.jpg" target="_blank">10+ years old photograph</a>), following football, and keeping up with the latest in technology, including programming, new gadgets, innovative concepts, AI, UI/UX, and apps.</p>
