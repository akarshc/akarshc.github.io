			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>Hello, I am Akarsh, a <strong>full-stack developer and UI/UX designer</strong>. I've been creating some stuffs on the web since 2010. Spending time on writing for multiple blogs, developing and designing websites are some of my passions throughout these years. I have completed Bachelors in Computer Application degree from St. Joseph's College of Devagiri, Calicut, Kerala, India.</p>
			<p>I am always curious about what is the next innovations that can change the world. There are times where I can create some stuffs which already exists, but my mind almost seek to find something new.</p>
			<p>Still I'm chasing to create some things that matters; atleast a thing which can help someone make their life easier, better and productive.</p>
