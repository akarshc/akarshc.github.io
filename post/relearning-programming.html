        I’ve been in the tech industry for about 15 years. In my early days, I tried to create something to make money without any coding knowledge, using WordPress, SEO, and other basic tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later, I built a web app and had the chance to explore more parts of tech, including proper coding (even though my early code wasn’t very impressive), databases, deployment, Nginx, frontend development, and backend APIs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I took a break from building for about five years to focus on work. One day, I realized that if I didn’t start making something now, I might never get the chance because I could get busier over time. So I decided to start building again.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first couple of days, I felt blank and distracted by social media and everything around me. Then I thought of learning a new language or framework to occupy my mind, take advantage of this time, and increase my capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am already familiar with languages like JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby. I became interested in <strong>Rust</strong> because it allows you to explore memory allocation, type safety, and other low-level concepts. I started reading the documentation and watching tutorials. At first, I was impressed because Rust gives almost C-like speed with much stronger safety guarantees. I experimented on the Rust playground and gained a good understanding of pointers, immutability, and other concepts, though I haven’t explored in-depth server-side development yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, I learned <strong>Go</strong>. Go is my first recommendation if you want the best performance for server APIs, with high speed, scalability, efficiency, and simplicity. I tried examples in the Go playground and loved how quickly I could build APIs with such performance. But I wasn’t a fan of some of its error-handling patterns and type system choices, such as the way enums work.
      </p>

      <p>
        I then decided to build an API with Go. I started with <strong>Gin</strong> and implemented simple features, including input fields and saving data, while connecting the app to a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database. I added JWT-based authentication using the <strong>golang-jwt</strong> library. I also experimented with <strong>GORM</strong> for ORM in one project and <strong>SQLx</strong> in another. My takeaway is that if you want full control, SQLx is better; if you want to ship quickly with slightly less control, GORM is fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        After experimenting with multiple languages and frameworks, I now have a broader and deeper understanding of programming. I am still learning every day, exploring everything from hardware to software that catches my interest, although I sometimes get stuck on simple programming questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For learning, I used AI only to get definitions, syntax explanations, or “how-to” guidance. I strictly did not use AI to generate code for me. I wanted to learn step by step, from reading to practicing and writing code myself.
