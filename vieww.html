			<h3>Themes</h3>
			<p>We have made the simplest possible themes for your profile. Besides that, when the customization is applied on top, it would look more unique indeed. The cusotomization includes changing: <strong>fonts, colors</strong> and putting your <strong>essential profile information</strong>.</p>
			<p>We created this application putting simplicity in mind; that's the reason for the very slight customization other than draging and changing aligments like any other website creators out there.</p>
